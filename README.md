# Fredt
This is Fredt, a self playing guitar that can play, in theory, any melody using the top 9 frets of the guitar.

I have been building projects since I was small. Built my first circuit when I was 8 years old. It was a handheld 
torch made from old popsicle sticks and a gluegun. This project represents my attempt to improve and take on larger, more complex builds.
The idea came from me playing guitar and wishing I was better. No better way to fix that problem other than to make
a completely over engineered project.
